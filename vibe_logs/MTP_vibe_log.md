Summarize this paper and explain the main ideas using analogies for someone with only basic ML knowledge to understand

## Response:
Got it—let’s break this paper down in a way that’s approachable for someone with just **basic ML knowledge**. I’ll summarize the main ideas and then use analogies so the concepts feel more intuitive.

* * *

📌 What the Paper is About
--------------------------

The paper introduces **Meaning-Typed Programming (MTP)**, a new way to make programming with **LLMs (Large Language Models)** much easier.

Right now, if you want an LLM (like GPT-4) to help in your program, you need to:

1.  Manually write prompts (instructions in plain English).
2.  Parse messy outputs into structured data.
3.  Handle errors and retries if the model produces weird results.

This is called **prompt engineering**, and it’s a lot of work.

MTP proposes a **new programming abstraction** that automates all of this. Instead of thinking about prompts, you write code like normal, and the system automatically generates the right prompts and handles the LLM’s responses.

* * *

⚙️ Key Innovations
------------------

MTP adds three main building blocks:

1.  **The `by` operator**
    *   Lets you call an LLM like you would call a function.
    *   Example:
        ```python
        def calc_age(birth: date, today: date) -> int by gpt4()
        ```
        Instead of writing logic, this tells the system: “Use GPT-4 to figure this out.”
2.  **MT-IR (Meaning-Typed Intermediate Representation)**
    *   Like a “cheat sheet” for the LLM that captures what your code _means_ (variable names, function types, expected outputs).
    *   Ensures the LLM gets structured, context-rich prompts.
3.  **MT-Runtime**
    *   At runtime, it manages everything:
        *   Generates context-aware prompts.
        *   Calls the LLM.
        *   Converts the LLM’s text back into proper data types.
        *   Handles errors and retries automatically.

* * *

🎮 Example (Video Game Levels)
------------------------------

Imagine you’re coding a video game where each level gets harder.

*   **Traditional way**: You’d write a lot of math and logic to decide how many enemies, how big the map should be, etc.
*   **Prompt-engineering way**: You’d write a giant text instruction to the LLM like:
    > “Generate the next level. Increase difficulty by 1. Add more enemies. Output JSON with this schema…”  
    > Then parse the messy output yourself.
*   **MTP way**: Just write:
    ```python
    def get_next_level(prev: Level) -> Level by gpt4()
    ```
    The system automatically knows from your `Level` class structure what to ask the LLM and how to turn the result back into code.

**Analogy**:

*   Traditional = you bake the cake from scratch.
*   Prompt engineering = you order a cake but have to write a super-detailed recipe for the baker, then reshape the cake after it arrives.
*   MTP = you just say “I need a chocolate cake for 6 people” and the system handles the rest.

* * *

📊 Results
----------

The paper tested MTP against other frameworks (like **LMQL** and **DSPy**). Key findings:

*   Developers were **3.2× faster** and wrote **45% fewer lines of code**.
*   Accuracy was as good as or better than alternatives.
*   Used **fewer tokens** (cheaper to run).
*   Robust even if code naming conventions were messy.
*   Developers in user studies overwhelmingly preferred MTP.

* * *

🧩 Analogies for Main Ideas
---------------------------

*   **`by` operator** = a universal translator. Instead of you learning a new language (prompts), it translates your code’s intent into instructions the LLM understands.
*   **MT-IR** = a cheat sheet. It preserves the _meaning_ of your code so the LLM doesn’t get confused.
*   **MT-Runtime** = a personal assistant. It not only sends messages to the LLM but also cleans up the answers, making sure they fit into your program.

* * *

🏁 Big Picture
--------------

MTP makes programming with AI feel like programming with **regular libraries or functions**. Instead of treating LLMs like an unpredictable black box you have to babysit with prompts, MTP makes them a **native part of the language**.

👉 In simple terms:  
MTP turns “AI as a messy collaborator” into “AI as a clean, built-in tool.”

* * *

Do you want me to also create a **visual analogy diagram** (like a side-by-side of “manual prompt engineering vs. MTP” with a cooking or game analogy) to make it even clearer?

## Prompt:
Go more in depth this was too high level. Break it down based on the sections of the paper and go in depth on each section of the paper

## Response:
Thought for 1m 28s

I need to break down the paper section by section and include citations using the special marker `【message_idx†source】`. The first citation will be from file\_search message \[7\], so that’s where the index comes from. I’m wondering about the exact format for `source` here. It's different from the usual citation rules.

I’m a bit puzzled because the developer’s instructions usually specify citations in the form `(website)` or file navlists, but the file\_search message suggests using special markers like `【message_idx†source】`. I’m wondering if the “source” refers to page numbers instead, but I’ll stick with the normal citation format unless directed otherwise.

The first file\_search result contains parsed text with page numbers, but not a 'turn' ID like I expected. I may need to use `msearch` to gather more appropriate file IDs, and then apply a `source_filter` to focus on uploaded files. I'll look for specific terms and cite accordingly.

Reading documents

I’ll start by clicking to open relevant sections like the introduction, motivating example, evaluation, user study, and results graphs. By doing this, I can gather the needed information and properly include citations throughout the document.

Reading documents

I see that I need to use the citation marker "(website)" for file references, but there’s some confusion with the numbering. The instruction also asks for line ranges for each claim according to the file rules. So, I'll make sure to cite the exact pages and line ranges from the file\_search results.

The content from the mclick shows segmented line numbers for different pages, so I’ll cite by range. For instance, the introduction might use lines \[L13-L26\]. I’ll also reference embedded images like “Figure 7 on page 8” and cite related lines. I’ll break the document down by sections: Abstract, Motivating Example, etc.

I'll break the sections down like this: Problem, Objectives, and Challenges with specific labels (O1, O2, C1-C4), then Meaning Typed Programming (MT-IR, MT-Runtime, etc.), Evaluation (benchmarks, case study), and Related Work. User wants depth, so I'll clarify with occasional analogies, but keep them brief. I’ll maintain a formal yet approachable tone while placing citations properly.

Citations will go at the end of the relevant paragraphs, potentially multiple ones per paragraph. I'll make sure to reference images like "Figure 1 page 2" and "Figure 7 page 8." I also need to avoid making ungrounded claims. Following those guidelines, I'll compose and complete the response now, as per the requirement to avoid asynchronous work.

Done

Awesome—here’s a **section-by-section deep dive** of the paper, with plain-English explanations and just enough technical precision. I’ll also call out key figures/tables by page when they help.

* * *

1) Introduction (what problem they’re solving and the big idea)
===============================================================

**Problem.** Today’s “AI-integrated” apps (that call an LLM at runtime) force developers to: (a) hand-craft prompts, (b) shove program state into text, and (c) parse free-form text back into typed objects. Tools like LMQL, DSPy, and SGLang help, but still ask you to learn new DSLs, annotate schemas, and manually manage input/output conversions—so complexity just shifts around. 【

MTP

】

**Big idea (Meaning-Typed Programming, MTP).** Use the _semantic richness already present in code_—names, types, function signatures—to automatically:

1.  generate prompts, 2) call the LLM, and 3) convert the answer back into the expected type. MTP exposes this as a **language construct**: the `by` operator, backed by a semantic **Meaning-Typed IR (MT-IR)** at compile time and an **MT-Runtime** engine at run time. Implemented in **Jac** (a Python superset), MTP reduces code churn and developer effort while matching or beating accuracy and speed/cost. A user study showed **3.2× faster** task completion with **45% fewer LoC**. 【

**Helpful visual.** _Figure 1 on page 2_ contrasts traditional code, prompt-engineering pipelines, and the MTP flow where “prompting + parsing” is automated. 【

MTP

】

* * *

2) Motivating example (why prompt engineering hurts in practice)
================================================================

They build a small **pygame** RPG where each **Level** must be generated from the previous one. The _traditional_ way requires tricky procedural generation; the _prompt-engineering_ way requires a big, brittle prompt (with JSON schema rules) and a bunch of parsing helpers. See _Figure 4 on page 5_ for the long prompt and the downstream parsing. Pain points: verbose templates, nested output schemas, and no safety if the LLM returns malformed text; real programs also need retries. 【

MTP

】【

MTP

】

**MTP version.** Replace the body with a single declaration:

```python
def get_next_level(prev_levels: list[Level]) -> Level by llm
```

Now the system infers the intent from names/types, constructs the prompt, calls the LLM, and returns a proper `Level`. That’s literally the code in _Figure 5 on page 7_. 【

MTP

】

**Key insight.** Code already _encodes_ meaning: variable names (`prev_levels`), types (`Level`, `Map`, `Position`), and return types communicate intent; MTP mines that meaning instead of asking you to restate it in prose prompts. _Figure 6 on page 7_ shows mini examples (e.g., `french2english` implies translation). 【

MTP

* * *

3) Problem formulation, objectives, and challenges
==================================================

**Objectives (O1–O3).**

*   **O1:** Provide a simple, flexible language abstraction (hide prompt engineering).
*   **O2:** Extract _relevant_ semantics for automatic prompt synthesis.
*   **O3:** Combine those semantics with _runtime values_ and convert outputs to the expected types. 【
    MTP
    】

**Core challenges (C1–C4).**

*   **C1:** Make the abstraction both _easy_ and _orthogonally usable_ across functions, methods, constructors.
*   **C2:** Extract _only_ the necessary semantics (don’t dump the whole codebase into the prompt).
*   **C3:** Blend static code meaning with dynamic values at call time.
*   **C4:** Robustly parse/convert non-deterministic LLM outputs with minimal retries/cost.  
    (_Figure 7 on page 8_ diagrams the full stack and lists C1–C4.) 【
    MTP
    】

* * *

4) Meaning-Typed Programming (the machinery)
============================================

4.1 Overview
------------

MTP = **`by` operator** (language feature) + **MT-IR** (compile-time meaning store) + **MT-Runtime** (run-time engine). At definition/call sites using `by`, the runtime fetches the relevant MT-IR, binds live values, synthesizes a prompt, calls the LLM, and converts the result to the declared return type. (_Figure 7 on page 8_ shows the dataflow.) 【

MTP

】

4.2 The `by` operator (how you use it)
--------------------------------------

**Syntax.**

```
<code construct> by llm_ref(model_hyperparameters)
```

It’s attachable to:

*   **Functions** (replace the function body),
*   **Object initializations** (fill missing fields), and
*   **Methods** (use object context + parameters). 【
    MTP
    】

**Formal semantics.** They formalize execution as `invoke-model(model, θ, construct, values, types)` so the LLM sees: function/method signature, actual arguments and types, expected **return type**. That’s what gives it enough structure to do the right thing and emit convertable output. (_Equations (1)–(6) on pages 10–11_). 【

MTP

】【

MTP

】【

MTP

】

**Type & temporal guarantees.** If the output can’t be converted to the declared type, the runtime raises a type error; functions/methods are tagged at definition for MT-IR, executed via MT-Runtime at call time; constructor `by` runs immediately. (_Figure 8 on page 11_). 【

MTP

】

**Analogy:** `by` is like writing an interface—you specify “what” (signature & types), and a very smart service (LLM) plus the MTP toolchain figures out the “how”.

4.3 MT-IR (the meaning store built at compile time)
---------------------------------------------------

**What it captures.** For each `by` site, the compiler performs whole-program analysis to gather: the construct name, parameter/return types, and _recursively_ the definitions of any non-primitive types (e.g., `Level → Map → Wall → Position`). All of this becomes an **MT-IR entry** for that call site. (_Figure 9 on page 12_ shows code modules → semantic registry → MT-IR slice → generated prompt.) 【

MTP

】【

MTP

】

**How it’s built.**

1.  Build a cross-module **semantic registry** from ASTs (names, types, defs/uses).
2.  For each `by` site, collect the signature + recursively “expand” custom types down to primitives.
3.  Store that bundle as MT-IR.  
    They include **Algorithm 1** specifying this walk, and show the **Jac compiler flow** (AST → Typed AST → Python AST with runtime hooks → bytecode) in _Figure 10 on page 13_. 【
    MTP
    】【
    MTP
    】

**Why not include the whole file?** Token budgets and latency: they emphasize extracting only _relevant_ semantics (Challenge C2). 【

MTP

】

4.4 MT-Runtime (the engine at call time)
----------------------------------------

**Stage 1: Prompt Synthesis.** On a `by` call, the runtime loads the MT-IR slice, grabs live argument values from the VM’s object graph, and fills a _general template_: action (from function/method name), _Type\_Explanations_ (from MT-IR), and output schema (return type). _Figure 11 on page 14_ is a nice block diagram of the loop. 【

MTP

】

**Stage 2: Output conversion and repair.** They ask the LLM to emit a value in a **Python-constructible** form (e.g., `Person(name="Albert Einstein", dob="03/14/1879")`) and then call `ast.literal_eval` to produce the actual object. If conversion fails, they generate a compact “correction” prompt explaining the mismatch and retry up to a developer-set bound. This keeps retries cheap and targeted. 【

MTP

】【

MTP

】

**Analogy:** Think of MT-Runtime as a **traffic cop**—it routes the right facts to the model, and then verifies the car that comes back is the _right make/model_ (type) before letting it onto your program’s highway.

* * *

5) Evaluation (does it actually help?)
======================================

Benchmarks & setup
------------------

They build a suite across 13 tasks (math, translation, template fill, “text → typed object”, game level generation, Wikipedia/ReAct, etc.). Tasks include objective checks (exact match) or model/human judgments (GPTScore, human for the level game). (_Table 1 on page 15_). 【

MTP

】

5.1 Case study (RPG levels)
---------------------------

They re-implement the level generator in LMQL, DSPy, and MTP (_Figure 13 on page 17_). LMQL requires a long template with field-wise constraints; DSPy needs Pydantic `BaseModel` + `Field` annotations; MTP is a two-liner with `by`. The absence of hand prompts doesn’t hurt MTP—code semantics (e.g., `prev_levels`, `difficulty`) suffice to drive the LLM to harder levels next. 【

MTP

】【

MTP

】【

MTP

】

5.2 Lines of Code (integration effort)
--------------------------------------

Across benchmarks, **MTP needs the fewest LoC changes** to add an LLM feature; it beats LMQL ~**4.0×** and DSPy ~**5.3×** on average (_Figure 14 & Table 2 on page 18_). 【

MTP

】【

MTP

】

5.3 User study (20 devs)
------------------------

Participants implemented 3 tasks with LMQL/DSPy/MTP after a day of reading docs. **MTP had the highest success on 2/3 tasks and the most consistent outcomes**, while LMQL had the lowest success (hand prompts were hard). Subjective ratings (ease, docs, learning curve, efficiency, satisfaction) favored MTP. (_Figures 15–17 on pages 19–20_). 【

MTP

】【

MTP

】

5.4 Accuracy (vs LMQL/DSPy)
---------------------------

Over 13 tasks, all frameworks clear 50% accuracy, but **MTP ≈ DSPy and > LMQL**; average correctness: LMQL 90.85%, DSPy 98.23%, **MTP 98.92%**. On **GSM8K** (math) across OpenAI/Llama model families, **MTP tracks or slightly beats DSPy**, and notably _improves as newer models arrive_, suggesting rich code semantics + minimal prompt scaffolding scales with model quality (_Figures 18–21 on pages 21–22_). 【

MTP

】【

MTP

】

5.5 Tokens, cost, runtime
-------------------------

**MTP uses fewer tokens** than DSPy (lower prompt/completion totals) and therefore **cuts cost and latency** (e.g., ≥3.5× cost savings on the math benchmark; up to ~4× cost + speed improvement on “odd word out”). (_Figures 22–23 on page 23_). 【

MTP

】

5.6 Robustness to poor naming
-----------------------------

They degrade names progressively (short/25%/50%/75%/100% renamed, plus “cryptic”). **MTP stays ~98% correct** at 25–50%, **~70%** at ~70% bad naming, and **~20%** at 100%. “Cryptic but consistent” naming yields ~60%. Conclusion: semantics help a lot, but you can’t remove _all_ human-meaning and expect magic. (_Figure 24 on page 23–24_). 【

MTP

】【

MTP

】

5.7 Multimodal extension
------------------------

Using a simple `Image` type adapter, the same `by` abstraction works for visual QA tasks (CLEVR, Scallop set). _Figure 25 on page 24_ shows the tiny program; the type works like a modality adapter. 【

6) Related work (where it sits)
===============================

*   **LLM-as-code-generator:** Pythoness, etc. (different goal: synthesize code).
*   **Runtime LLM frameworks:** LMQL, DSPy, SGLang—useful, but still require DSLs, annotations, and/or manual schemas.
*   **Prompt-structuring tools:** Outlines, TypeChat help with typed outputs but still live “on top of” prompt engineering.  
    MTP differs by **moving LLM integration into the language** with a stable operator + compiler/runtime support. 【
    MTP
    】

* * *

7) Conclusion (what to take away)
=================================

MTP shows that **“less prompt is more”** when the compiler/runtime can _lift intent from code_. The `by` operator + MT-IR + MT-Runtime trio automate prompt construction, inference, type-safe conversion, and error repair. In experiments, this **cuts developer effort**, **reduces tokens/cost/latency**, and **matches or exceeds** accuracy of popular frameworks. 【

MTP

】

* * *

TL;DR in one line
-----------------

MTP treats LLMs like **first-class language features**—you declare _what_ you want via types and names, and the system handles _how_ to talk to the model and make the result safe to use.

If you want, I can turn this into a one-page cheat sheet (with the three core figures—system overview, MT-IR pipeline, runtime loop—annotated) so you’ve got a quick reference for exams or project writeups.

## Prompt:
Is MTP usable in Python?

## Response:
Yes — MTP is usable **through Jac**, which is a **production-grade superset of Python**.

Here’s how it works according to the paper:

*   The authors implemented MTP inside **Jac** (an open-source language built on top of Python)
    MTP
    .
*   The **`by` operator** is introduced as a new language construct in Jac, so you can write something like:
    ```python
    from mtp.core.llms import OpenAI
    llm = OpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o")
    def get_next_level(prev_levels: list[Level]) -> Level by llm
    ```
    This looks and feels like Python, but the `by` keyword is extra syntax added by Jac.
*   Under the hood:
    *   **MT-IR** is built during Jac’s compilation step (it analyzes Python AST + type info).
    *   **MT-Runtime** is installed as a PyPI package that hooks into the Python VM at runtime.
        MTP
        MTP
*   You can still use normal Python code in Jac — so effectively, **MTP is Python-compatible**, but you need the Jac toolchain (compiler + runtime plugin) to enable the `by` operator and meaning-typed features.

* * *

✅ **Short answer**: MTP is not part of standard Python yet, but you can use it in **Jac**, which is Python with MTP features added.

Would you like me to show you **how to install Jac + the MTP runtime in a Python project** so you could actually try it?

## Prompt:
What is the difference between Jac and Python?

## Response:
Great question. Think of **Jac** as “Python++”: it’s fully Python-compatible, but adds extra **language constructs and runtime support** for AI integration and distributed programming. Let me break down the differences based on the paper and the Jac docs.

* * *

🔑 Similarities
---------------

*   **Syntax & semantics:** Jac is a **superset of Python** — meaning any valid Python code is also valid Jac code. You can still use Python libraries, data structures, and tooling.
*   **Execution:** Jac compiles down to **Python bytecode** and runs on the standard Python VM.
    MTP
*   **Ecosystem:** You can import and use existing Python packages.

* * *

🚀 Differences (what Jac adds on top of Python)
-----------------------------------------------

### 1\. **New language constructs**

*   The most important for this paper: the **`by` operator**.
    ```python
    def calc_age(birth: date, today: date) -> int by gpt4()
    ```
    This tells Jac: “Let an LLM handle this function” — something plain Python cannot do.
*   Jac also introduces other constructs (from the Jaseci project) for **graph-based programming** and **agent orchestration** — helpful in distributed AI applications.

* * *

### 2\. **Compiler extensions**

*   Jac adds a compiler phase that extracts **semantic information** (names, types, structures) into **MT-IR (Meaning-Typed Intermediate Representation)**.
*   Standard Python compilation loses a lot of this rich information once code is bytecode. Jac preserves it so LLMs can be prompted automatically with structured context.
    MTP

* * *

### 3\. **Runtime system**

*   Jac’s **MT-Runtime** sits inside the Python VM.
*   When you hit a `by` site, it dynamically:
    1.  Looks up semantic info from MT-IR.
    2.  Binds runtime values.
    3.  Generates a prompt.
    4.  Calls the LLM.
    5.  Converts output back into proper Python objects.
        MTP

In pure Python, you’d have to hand-craft all of these steps.

* * *

### 4\. **Programming paradigm**

*   Python = **general-purpose imperative language.**
*   Jac = Python + **AI-first extensions** (e.g., LLM integration, multi-agent systems, distributed graph-based workflows).
*   In other words, Jac is meant for **building AI-native applications** while keeping Python familiarity.

* * *

⚖️ Analogy
----------

*   Python is like a **standard car**.
*   Jac is the **same car but factory-upgraded** with an autopilot system (AI integration), better navigation (semantic IR), and self-repair (runtime error correction). You can still drive it manually (Python code), but you get advanced capabilities if you use the upgrades.

* * *

✅ **Summary:**  
Jac is essentially **Python with extra language constructs and runtime features**. You can write plain Python in Jac, but Jac lets you use the `by` operator, semantic compilation, and AI/runtime integrations that don’t exist in standard Python.

* * *

Do you want me to put together a **side-by-side code comparison** (Python vs Jac with MTP) to show exactly what changes in practice?

## Prompt:
Is Jac a new language just for MTP or does it exist outside of MTP contexts?

## Response:
Jac is **not just for MTP** — it’s a broader language that already existed, and MTP was built on top of it.

Here’s the breakdown:

* * *

🌐 Origins of Jac
-----------------

*   Jac comes from the **Jaseci project** (open-source since ~2023)
    MTP
    .
*   It was designed as a **Python superset** for **orchestrating AI systems**, especially **multi-agent workflows** and **graph-based programming**.
*   So Jac already had features for:
    *   Graph traversal and manipulation.
    *   Distributed computing.
    *   Agent-based architectures.

* * *

🧩 Where MTP fits in
--------------------

*   MTP leverages Jac because Jac already had an **extensible compiler and runtime**.
*   The authors added:
    1.  **The `by` operator** (new Jac syntax).
    2.  **MT-IR compiler pass** (to preserve semantic info).
    3.  **MT-Runtime plugin** (for LLM prompt synthesis + type conversion).
        MTP
        MTP

So MTP is **an extension inside Jac**, not the reason Jac exists.

* * *

✅ Summary
---------

*   **Jac existed before MTP** as a Python superset aimed at **AI-native, graph-based, and multi-agent programming**.
*   **MTP is a new module within Jac** (available as `byLLM`) that makes LLMs a first-class citizen in the language.
*   You can use Jac without MTP (for graph-based AI systems), and you can use MTP because Jac provided the right foundation.

* * *

Would you like me to also show you some **non-MTP Jac examples** (like its graph/agent programming features) so you see what else the language can do outside of LLM integration?

## Prompt:
Is my understanding of MT-IR and MT-Runtime correct? MT-IR is something that is ran when Jac code is compiled into Python code. It parses the code to understand what is relevant information for each MTP by call and puts the information into that prompt for that by call. MT-Runtime is something that runs during runtime whenever the by call is ran to ensure that the calls are done correctly and any error handling or parsing is correctly handled.

## Response:
Yes 👍 — your understanding is spot on. Let me refine it with some detail from the paper so you have a crisp mental model:

* * *

🏗️ MT-IR (Meaning-Typed Intermediate Representation)
-----------------------------------------------------

*   **When it happens:** At **compile time** (Jac → Python bytecode).
*   **What it does:**
    *   Walks through the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
    *   Collects **semantic info**: variable names, function/method signatures, type annotations, class definitions (recursively, even across modules).
    *   Stores this in a structured “cheat sheet” (the MT-IR) for each `by` site.
        MTP
        MTP
*   **Why it matters:** By the time code is Python bytecode, you’ve lost rich semantics (types, naming, structure). MT-IR preserves that so the runtime knows _what to tell the LLM_.
*   **Analogy:** Think of MT-IR as the **shopping list** prepared before you go to the store. It organizes everything you’ll need later so you don’t waste time searching when you’re actually running errands.

* * *

⚙️ MT-Runtime
-------------

*   **When it happens:** At **runtime**, whenever a `by` call is executed.
*   **What it does:**
    1.  Loads the relevant MT-IR entry (semantic context).
    2.  Collects **live runtime values** (like function arguments).
    3.  Synthesizes a prompt combining static meaning + dynamic values.
    4.  Calls the LLM.
    5.  Converts the output back into the declared type (using parsing + `ast.literal_eval`).
    6.  If parsing/type conversion fails, retries with an error-correcting mini-prompt.
        MTP
        MTP
*   **Why it matters:** Handles the messy, nondeterministic side of LLMs (weird outputs, type mismatches) _without developer intervention_.
*   **Analogy:** MT-Runtime is like the **kitchen chef**. You give it the shopping list (MT-IR) and fresh ingredients (runtime values), it cooks the dish, and if the dish isn’t right, it fixes it or retries.

* * *

✅ **Your phrasing is correct:**

*   MT-IR = compile-time prep, captures semantic meaning.
*   MT-Runtime = runtime executor, manages actual LLM calls, parsing, and error handling.

* * *

Would you like me to also sketch out a **step-by-step trace of one `by` call** (from source code → MT-IR → runtime prompt → parsed output) so you see the two pieces working together in action?

## Prompt:
What is the actual prompt that MT-Runtime synthesizes and how did the paper come up with this specific prompt?

## Response:
Great question — this gets into the **nuts and bolts** of how MTP bridges code → LLM.

* * *

📝 What the MT-Runtime Prompt Looks Like
----------------------------------------

The paper shows an example prompt synthesized for the video game **`get_next_level`** function (_Figure 9d, page 12_). It has several structured sections:

```
[System Prompt]
This is an operation you must perform and return the output values. ...

[Inputs_Information]
(prev_levels) (list[Level]) = ...

[Output_Information]
(Level)

[Type_Explanations]
(Level) (obj) eg:- Level(level_id=int, .., map=Map)
(Map) (obj) eg:- Map(enemies=list[Position], player_pos=Position, walls=list[Wall])
(Position) (obj) eg:- Position(x=int, y=int)
(Wall) (obj) eg:- Wall(start_pos=Position, end_pos=Position)

[Action]
get_next_level
Generate and return the output result(s) only, adhering to the provided Type in the following format

[Output]
<result>
```

⚙️ How They Came Up With It
---------------------------

The design of the prompt was **guided by the MT-IR structure**. During compilation, the MT-IR collects:

1.  **Function/method name** → becomes the `[Action]`.
2.  **Inputs (with types)** → become `[Inputs_Information]`.
3.  **Return type** → becomes `[Output_Information]`.
4.  **Nested type definitions** (from semantic registry) → become `[Type_Explanations]`.
5.  **Expected schema** → constrains LLM output so parsing → Python objects is easy.

At runtime, **MT-Runtime merges MT-IR (static info)** with **live variable values (dynamic info)** and slots them into this template.

* * *

🔑 Why This Prompt Design?
--------------------------

They had to balance **3 competing needs** (Challenges C2–C4 from §3):

*   **Rich enough for accuracy**: give the LLM names, types, and schemas so it knows what’s being asked.
*   **Concise enough for token efficiency**: avoid dumping the entire codebase.
*   **Structured enough for safe parsing**: force outputs into known Python object schemas so `ast.literal_eval` can reconstruct the objects.

That’s why the sections look like a **typed API spec** instead of free-text instructions. It’s not “chatty English,” but a **scaffolded schema** that aligns with the MT-IR fields.

* * *

🔎 Analogy
----------

Think of the MT-Runtime prompt as a **form letter**:

*   The compiler (MT-IR) pre-fills the fields: “Inputs,” “Types,” “Outputs,” “Definitions.”
*   At runtime, values are filled in (“this `Level` object”).
*   The LLM just has to complete the form and hand back a filled-in template.

* * *

✅ **In short:**  
The MT-Runtime prompt is a structured template derived from MT-IR. It encodes inputs, outputs, type explanations, and the action name. The authors designed it by asking: “What’s the minimal set of semantics an LLM needs to reliably act like a function, while still being cheap to run and easy to parse?”

* * *

Do you want me to **walk through a concrete example** (e.g., the `calc_age(birth: date, today: date) -> int by gpt4()` function) and show what exact prompt would be generated for that simpler case?

## Prompt:
How does this differ from DSPy or LMQL and how are they achieving better performance than the other models?

## Response:
Excellent question — this is where the paper really positions **MTP** against **DSPy** and **LMQL**. Let me unpack it systematically.

* * *

🆚 LMQL (Language Model Query Language)
---------------------------------------

*   **What it is:** A DSL (SQL-like) for LLMs. You write queries with **constraints** that control how the model outputs tokens (like “this must be an int” or “this field must be greater than X”).
*   **How it works:** You still write **big prompt templates** with placeholders. LMQL helps you enforce structure and iterate token-by-token to fill fields.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   You’re still doing manual prompt engineering (writing the base prompt in English).
    *   Steep learning curve (new language).
    *   More code churn for structured outputs.
*   **In practice:** _Figure 13a (p. 17)_ shows LMQL’s level generator: ~58 lines of code, still including a long hand-written prompt.
    MTP

* * *

🆚 DSPy
-------

*   **What it is:** A Python framework for declaratively defining LLM calls. You describe inputs/outputs using `dspy.Signature` and type annotations (often with **Pydantic models**).
*   **How it works:** DSPy builds prompt templates from your structured signatures, and can “compile” prompts by running search over many variations with training examples.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   You must **explicitly annotate all types** (e.g., make every class inherit from Pydantic’s `BaseModel`, add `Field` descriptions).
    *   Some complexity just shifts from prompts → heavy annotations.
    *   Prompt “compilation” can require training data and time.
*   **In practice:** _Figure 13b (p. 17)_ shows DSPy’s level generator: ~36 lines of code, with lots of explicit Pydantic boilerplate.
    MTP

* * *

🆚 MTP
------

*   **What it is:** A **language-level abstraction** (`by`) with compiler/runtime support.
*   **How it works:**
    1.  MT-IR auto-extracts semantics (function names, type hints, variable names) at compile time.
    2.  MT-Runtime merges semantics + runtime values into a structured prompt.
    3.  Output is parsed automatically into the expected Python types.
*   **Why it’s better:**
    *   **No manual prompts** (unlike LMQL).
    *   **No heavy annotations** (unlike DSPy).
    *   **Minimal code changes** (LoC reduced 4–5×).
    *   **Leverages what’s already in code** (names, type hints, return types) instead of asking the programmer to restate them.

* * *

📊 Why MTP Outperforms Them
---------------------------

From evaluation (§5):

1.  **Lines of Code / Complexity**
    *   LMQL requires ~4× more lines of code, DSPy ~5× more than MTP (on average). _Figure 14 (p. 18)_.
        MTP
2.  **User Study**
    *   Developers were 3.2× faster with MTP.
    *   Highest success rates, best subjective ratings. _Figures 15–17 (pp. 19–20)_.
        MTP
3.  **Accuracy**
    *   LMQL: ~91% average correctness.
    *   DSPy: ~98.2%.
    *   **MTP: ~98.9%.**
    *   On GSM8K math problems, MTP matched or beat DSPy, especially with newer models (_Figures 18–21, pp. 21–22_).
        MTP
    **Key insight:** MTP’s lightweight prompts scale _better_ as LLMs improve, because the LLMs don’t need extra scaffolding to understand code semantics. DSPy’s accuracy plateaued or dropped slightly with newer models.
4.  **Token Usage & Cost**
    *   MTP uses **fewer tokens** because prompts only include relevant type/semantic info, not full verbose schemas or annotation text.
    *   Cuts **cost up to 4.5×** and improves runtime speed ~4×. _Figures 22–23 (p. 23)_.
        MTP
5.  **Robustness**
    *   Even with 50% bad naming, MTP stayed ~98% accurate. DSPy/LMQL require clean manual annotations or prompts. _Figure 24 (p. 23–24)_.
        MTP

* * *

⚖️ Analogy
----------

*   **LMQL:** Like writing a recipe in natural language, but with strict rules (“must add 2 cups sugar, must not exceed 3 eggs”). You still write the whole recipe.
*   **DSPy:** Like filling out a detailed **government form** — you specify every field and format explicitly, then the LLM follows the form.
*   **MTP:** Like a **smart assistant who reads your grocery list** (your code) and just figures out what recipe you meant, filling in missing steps.

* * *

✅ **Summary**:  
MTP outperforms LMQL and DSPy because it **automates prompt engineering entirely** using compiler/runtime support. Instead of requiring manual prompt writing (LMQL) or annotation overhead (DSPy), it extracts meaning from the code itself. This makes programs shorter, faster, cheaper, and just as accurate (if not more) — especially as LLMs get smarter.

* * *

Do you want me to also build a **side-by-side table (MTP vs DSPy vs LMQL)** summarizing _developer effort, runtime cost, accuracy, and scalability_? That way you can see the comparison at a glance.

## Prompt:
The paper mentions robustness to poor naming, but what is defined as poor naming? How are they measuring the level of poor naming? Can you give a couple of examples?

## Response:
Great catch — the robustness study (§5.6 in the paper) digs into exactly what they mean by **“poor naming.”** Let’s break it down carefully.

* * *

🛠️ What “poor naming” means here
---------------------------------

Since MTP leans heavily on **semantic richness in code** (e.g., variable names, class names, type hints), the authors wanted to test how fragile it is when those names become _less meaningful_.

They simulate **progressive degradation of code semantics** by altering identifiers (variable names, function names, class names, attribute names).

* * *

📏 Levels of Poor Naming
------------------------

They tested **four styles of degradation** (Figure 24, p. 23–24)

MTP

MTP

:

1.  **Shortened but still meaningful names**
    *   Example: `previous_level` → `prev_lvl`
    *   Still human-readable, common in coding.
    *   Result: _No drop in correctness._
2.  **Partial renaming (25%, 50%, 75% of identifiers)**
    *   Replace a percentage of identifiers with meaningless ones (like `a1`, `b2`, `c3`).
    *   Example:
        *   At 25%: `Level` stays, but `player_pos` → `p1`.
        *   At 50%: `enemy_count` → `x`, `map` → `m`.
        *   At 75%: most identifiers reduced to single letters.
    *   Result: Still ~98% correct at 25–50%, but dropped to ~70% at 75%.
3.  **100% bad naming**
    *   _All_ identifiers replaced with cryptic letters.
    *   Example:
        ```python
        class L:
            a: int
            b: int
            c: int
            d: list[X]
        ```
        instead of
        ```python
        class Level:
            level_id: int
            difficulty: int
            num_enemies: int
            map: Map
        ```
    *   Result: Accuracy plummeted to ~20%.
4.  **Cryptic but consistent renaming**
    *   Identifiers are _internally consistent_ but misleading.
    *   Example: `Level` → `Boss`, `Wall` → `Chasm`.
    *   So the structure is there, but semantics are misleading.
    *   Result: ~60% correctness — better than 100% gibberish, worse than shortened abbreviations.

* * *

📊 How They Measure It
----------------------

*   They used the **video game level generation benchmark** (same motivating example).
*   For each degradation level, they ran 100 trials and measured the **probability of generating correct outputs** (based on Table 1 correctness criteria: e.g., playable levels, harder than previous, valid positions).
*   Figure 24 shows the curve: correctness stays high until about 50% degradation, then falls off.

* * *

✅ Takeaway
----------

*   **“Poor naming” = progressively stripping away or corrupting semantic meaning from identifiers.**
*   **Examples:**
    *   Meaningful → `player_position`
    *   Shortened → `p_pos`
    *   Abbreviated/generic → `p1`
    *   Cryptic/misleading → `portal` (when it really means `wall`)
    *   Nonsense → `x1, x2, x3`
*   **MTP is resilient**: it handles shorthand and partial loss of semantics surprisingly well (up to ~50% degradation). But if you nuke _all_ semantics, the system struggles, since it has nothing meaningful to turn into prompts.

* * *

Would you like me to **mock up an actual before-and-after code snippet** (original vs. 50% bad naming vs. 100% bad naming) so you can _see_ how the code semantics degrade and why MTP eventually fails?

## Prompt:
How are all the objectives met and all the challenges solved?

## Response:
Perfect — let’s map this systematically. The paper frames **3 objectives (O1–O3)** and **4 challenges (C1–C4)**. Each piece of MTP (the `by` operator, MT-IR, MT-Runtime) is designed to satisfy them.

* * *

🎯 Objectives vs. Solutions
===========================

### **O1 – Simple, intuitive, flexible language abstraction**

*   **Challenge:** Hide prompt engineering but still let developers integrate LLMs flexibly.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Introduce the **`by` operator** — a single keyword that can attach to:
        *   Functions (`def f(...) -> T by llm`)
        *   Methods (`class C: def m(...) -> T by llm`)
        *   Object initializations (`Person("Einstein") by llm`)
    *   This makes AI-integration look like normal Python typing, no new DSL required.
    *   Developers write code _as usual_; MTP inserts the AI where needed.
        MTP
        MTP

* * *

### **O2 – Automatically extract semantics for prompt synthesis**

*   **Challenge:** Don’t overwhelm the LLM with irrelevant code, but give it enough structure.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **MT-IR (Meaning-Typed Intermediate Representation):**
        *   Built during compilation (Jac → Python).
        *   Collects semantic context: names, type annotations, class hierarchies, return types.
        *   Recursively expands custom types (e.g., `Level → Map → Wall → Position`) so the model gets the full schema without needing the full source code.
        *   Stored as structured data that can be looked up at runtime.
    *   Ensures **only relevant info** is passed, keeping prompts concise and accurate.
        MTP
        MTP

* * *

### **O3 – Combine semantics with dynamic info at runtime**

*   **Challenge:** Must merge static “meaning” with live values, then safely parse outputs.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **MT-Runtime:**
        *   At a `by` call, it fetches the MT-IR entry, binds live arguments (`v1, v2,…`), and fills a structured prompt template (Figure 9d).
        *   Prompts contain `[Inputs_Information]`, `[Output_Information]`, `[Type_Explanations]`, and `[Action]`.
        *   Ensures the LLM is given _exactly what it needs_ to behave like the function.
            MTP
    *   **Output handling:**
        *   Uses Python’s `ast.literal_eval` to convert the LLM’s output back to typed objects.
        *   If parsing/type conversion fails, MT-Runtime auto-generates a **repair prompt** (short, focused on the mismatch) and retries until success or max retries.

            MTP

* * *

🧩 Challenges vs. Solutions
===========================

### **C1 – Intuitive abstraction but flexible integration**

*   Solved by the **`by` operator**: simple syntax, usable at multiple integration points (functions, methods, object init). No new language to learn, no manual schemas.
    MTP

* * *

### **C2 – Extract relevant semantics without overhead**

*   Solved by **MT-IR**: compiler pass traverses AST + semantic registry, collects only necessary type/structure info, and expands custom types into primitives. Avoids token bloat and context overflow.
    MTP
    MTP

* * *

### **C3 – Combine static meaning with runtime values**

*   Solved by **MT-Runtime prompt synthesis**: merges MT-IR (types, signatures) with actual values (object state, arguments). This ensures prompts are both **contextual** and **lightweight**.
    MTP

* * *

### **C4 – Robust output parsing & error handling**

*   Solved by **MT-Runtime output conversion loop**:
    *   Enforces type conformance (declared return type).
    *   Uses retries with auto-generated correction prompts when mismatches occur.
    *   Balances robustness with cost by making retries concise and schema-guided.
        MTP
        MTP

* * *

✅ Summary Table
===============

| Objective / Challenge | How It’s Solved |
| --- | --- |
| **O1 / C1 – Simple, flexible abstraction** | `by` operator integrates LLMs like normal code (functions, methods, constructors). |
| **O2 / C2 – Extract semantics efficiently** | MT-IR compiler pass captures relevant type/semantic info across modules. |
| **O3 / C3 – Merge static & dynamic info** | MT-Runtime synthesizes prompts by combining MT-IR with runtime values. |
| **C4 – Safe parsing & error handling** | MT-Runtime enforces type conversion, retries with correction prompts when needed. |

* * *

📌 **Big picture:**

*   **`by` operator** → solves simplicity (O1/C1).
*   **MT-IR** → solves semantic extraction (O2/C2).
*   **MT-Runtime** → solves runtime integration & robustness (O3/C3/C4).

Together, they hide prompt engineering completely while keeping LLMs accurate, efficient, and safe to integrate.

* * *

Would you like me to **trace a concrete example end-to-end** (say `calc_age(birth: date, today: date) -> int by gpt4()`) to show how each objective/challenge is addressed at each stage (compile → MT-IR → runtime → output)? That might make the mapping even clearer.

## Prompt:
How does MT-IR find the relevant semantics? How does MT-Runtime parse outputs and handle errors?

## Response:
Excellent follow-up 👌 — let’s dive into **MT-IR’s semantic extraction** and **MT-Runtime’s parsing + error-handling loop** step by step.

* * *

🔎 MT-IR: Finding Relevant Semantics
====================================

### ⚙️ The Problem

At compile time, MTP needs to know **what context is relevant** for each `by` call site. If it dumped the _whole codebase_ into the prompt, it would blow up token costs and possibly exceed context windows. So it must **selectively extract**.

### 🛠️ How MT-IR Does It

The Jac compiler inserts a pass that:

1.  **Builds a Semantic Registry** (Figure 9b, p. 12)
    MTP
    *   From the AST of each module.
    *   Stores variable names, function/method signatures, class definitions, and type annotations.
    *   Links _uses_ (e.g., `Level`) to _definitions_ (in `level.py`).
2.  **Locates each `by` call site** (Algorithm 1, p. 13)
    MTP
    :
    *   Is it a function, method, or constructor call?
    *   Collects the relevant signature (`inputs → output`).
3.  **Recursively expands non-primitive types**:
    *   Example: if a function returns `Level`, MT-IR finds `Level`’s definition.
    *   Then discovers that `Level` contains a `Map`, which contains `Wall` and `Position`.
    *   Each of those types is expanded until only primitives (ints, strings, floats) remain.
    *   This builds a tree of type semantics (_see Figure 9c–d_).
4.  **Stores this as an MT-IR entry** for the call site.
    *   MT-Runtime later uses this entry to generate `[Type_Explanations]` in the prompt.

✅ **In short:** MT-IR finds relevant semantics by **walking the AST and semantic registry**, recursively chasing type definitions, and trimming away irrelevant code.

**Analogy:** Like a librarian making a “reading packet” for one class: she pulls _only the chapters, references, and definitions you’ll actually need_ for that assignment, not the entire library.

* * *

⚙️ MT-Runtime: Parsing Outputs & Handling Errors
================================================

### ⚙️ The Problem

LLMs don’t always output exactly what you want:

*   Wrong format (`"thirty"` instead of `30`).
*   Wrong type (`"Level: {...}"` instead of a JSON/dict).
*   Extra chatter around the result.

### 🛠️ How MT-Runtime Handles It

As shown in _Figure 11, p. 14_

MTP

:

1.  **Prompt Synthesis**
    *   Takes MT-IR’s static semantics.
    *   Inserts runtime values (live arguments, object state).
    *   Fills a structured template (`[Inputs_Information]`, `[Type_Explanations]`, `[Output_Information]`, `[Action]`).
2.  **Ask LLM to output in evaluable Python form**
    *   Example: `Person(name="Albert Einstein", dob="03/14/1879")`.
    *   This matches Python’s syntax, so the runtime can reconstruct it directly.
3.  **Parsing Attempt**
    *   Uses `ast.literal_eval()` (safe Python parsing) to convert the string into the expected type.
    *   If success: returns the object (e.g., a valid `Level`).
    *   If failure: enters error handling.
4.  **Error Handling / Retry**
    *   Constructs a **revised correction prompt**:
        *   Includes the malformed output.
        *   States the _expected type/schema_.
        *   Example: “Your last output could not be parsed into a `Level`. Expected schema: … Please correct.”
    *   Re-sends this prompt to the LLM.
    *   Retries until:
        *   Type conversion succeeds, or
        *   A developer-specified max retry count is hit (then it raises a type error).

✅ **In short:** MT-Runtime parses by asking for outputs in typed Python-like format, converting via `literal_eval`, and using **concise corrective prompts** if conversion fails.

**Analogy:** Like a teacher collecting homework:

*   If it’s in the right format, she grades it.
*   If not, she hands it back with a sticky note: “Fix your answer so it’s in decimal form.” The student (LLM) corrects it. This continues until the answer fits the grading rubric or the teacher gives up.

* * *

✅ Summary
=========

*   **MT-IR:** During compilation, gathers only the _semantically relevant slice of code_ for each `by` call by recursively resolving types and building a semantic registry.
*   **MT-Runtime:** At runtime, uses MT-IR + live values to build structured prompts. It parses LLM outputs into typed objects, and when things go wrong, it retries with focused correction prompts.

* * *

Would you like me to **mock up an actual step-by-step trace** of `calc_age(birth: date, today: date) -> int by gpt4()` showing:

1.  What MT-IR captures,
2.  What MT-Runtime puts into the prompt,
3.  A sample LLM output, and
4.  How the runtime parses/corrects it?

## Prompt:
Yes please mock up an actual step-by-step trace

## Response:
Thought for 1m 15s

We need to create a step-by-step trace for the calc\_age function, incorporating MT-IR and MT-Runtime. First, for the "compile time MT-IR" step, we'll describe the semantic registry creation, capturing function signatures and types. The mockup should be based on the paper, with citations included, ensuring each claim from the paper is cited appropriately.

For the calc\_age mockup, I'll take care to use specific citations for various sections of the paper: L699-L709 for semantic registry, L720-L735 for extraction, and L935-L949 for the compilation pipeline. I'll also include other citation ranges as needed for operators, function semantics, evaluation, and prompt synthesis, to explain everything thoroughly.

I’ll show the success path, where the LLM returns the age correctly formatted as an int ("145"). If it instead returns something like "The age is 145 years," we’ll show the correction process: MT-Runtime sends a prompt to fix it and the LLM adjusts the output to "145". I’ll make sure to reference the paper with citations.

I’ll begin by showing the code snippet, followed by Step A for compilation. This includes the Jac compiler processing the `by` operator, building the semantic registry, and creating the MT-IR entry with the function `calc_age` and its types. I’ll clarify that specific values in the mockup are illustrative, so no citation is needed for those. However, the general steps and prompt sections will include citations.

Done

Awesome—here’s a concrete, end-to-end “trace” for a tiny function so you can see **what MT-IR collects** and **what MT-Runtime does** at call time. I’ll flag what’s mocked (just illustrative content) vs. what’s specified by the paper (cited).

* * *

Scenario
========

```python
from datetime import date
from mtp.core.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o")

# Jac (Python superset) with MTP:
def calc_age(birth: date, today: date) -> int by llm

# Later in code:
age = calc_age(date(1879, 3, 14), date(2024, 1, 1))
```

*   The **`by` operator** is the language hook that turns this function into an LLM-backed operation.
    MTP
*   MTP gives formal semantics for “functions with `by`” so the runtime knows to pass the **function signature, actual args (and types), and the expected return type** to an LLM invocation.
    MTP

* * *

A) Compile time (MT-IR)
=======================

A1. Build a semantic registry
-----------------------------

Jac’s compiler pass walks the AST of modules, building a **semantic registry** of names, types, defs/uses. This is cross-module (so it can resolve referenced types even if they live elsewhere).

MTP

A2. Locate each `by` call-site and record its essential semantics
-----------------------------------------------------------------

For the call-site associated with `calc_age`, the compiler records (Algorithm 1):

*   the **construct** (function `calc_age`),
*   **input types** `(date, date)`, **output type** `int`,
*   the target **model** (`llm`) and any hyperparams,
*   then **recursively expands** non-primitives if they’re user-defined (e.g., structs/classes) so the runtime has their fields at hand. (Here, `date` is a library type, so it likely stays as a leaf.)
    MTP

This “slice” becomes the **MT-IR entry** for the `calc_age` site. Think of it as a compact, per-site “cheat sheet” the runtime can use **without re-reading source code**.

MTP

A3. Lower to Python + register MT-IR
------------------------------------

Jac lowers to Python AST/bytecode **while retaining the MT-IR** and injecting hooks so the runtime can look it up at call time. (Figure 10 shows the pipeline.)

MTP

* * *

B) Run time (MT-Runtime)
========================

When `age = calc_age(...)` executes, MT-Runtime is triggered for this `by` site.

B1. Prompt synthesis
--------------------

The runtime **merges**:

*   **Static semantics** from the MT-IR (function name, param names + types, return type), and

### Mocked example prompt (for this small function)

_(The exact strings are illustrative, but the block structure and intent match the paper’s template.)_

```
[System Prompt]
You are performing a typed function. Return only the value that conforms to the declared output type.

[Inputs_Information]
(birth) (date) = "1879-03-14"
(today) (date) = "2024-01-01"

[Output_Information]
(int)

[Type_Explanations]
# (Omitted here since return type is primitive; if returning a custom object, this section
# lists field schemas like in Fig. 9d.)

[Action]
calc_age
Generate and return ONLY the output value conforming to the declared output type.

[Output]
<result>
```

> Why this shape? It’s the minimal **semantics-first** spec (names, types, expected output form) the model needs, keeping tokens low while making parsing easy. (Challenges C2–C3).

B2. Model reply — success path
------------------------------

Say the model returns just:

```
145
```

MT-Runtime uses safe parsing (e.g., `ast.literal_eval`) to convert that text to an `int`. Since it matches the declared return type, the value `145` is returned to the caller.

MTP

B3. Model reply — failure → correction loop
-------------------------------------------

Suppose the model first replies:

```
The person is 145 years old.
```

That **doesn’t** parse cleanly as an `int`. The runtime now constructs a **compact correction prompt** that (a) shows the bad output and (b) restates the expected type/schema, then **retries**. (Figure 11 shows this loop; §4.4 describes it.)

MTP

### Mocked correction prompt

```
Your previous output could not be parsed into the expected type.

[Previous_Output]
"The person is 145 years old."

[Expected_Type]
(int)

Return ONLY a valid value of the expected type with no extra text.
```

Typical second reply:

```
145
```

Now `literal_eval` succeeds → the function returns `145`. If the model keeps failing, the runtime retries up to a configured cap and then **raises a type error** (type safety guarantee).

Optional: method/context variant (what changes)
===============================================

If this were a **method** on a `Person` object—e.g., `def age(today: date) -> int by llm`—the runtime also supplies the **object’s state** (like `self.dob`) from the VM’s object graph so the LLM can use that context, per the method semantics in §4.2.3.

What to remember
----------------

*   **MT-IR (compile time):** builds a **per-site semantic slice**—just the names/types/signatures (and expanded custom types) the model needs—so prompts stay small and precise.
    MTP
    MTP
*   **MT-Runtime (run time):** fills the **structured prompt**, parses with `literal_eval`, and runs a **correction loop** on type mismatch—balancing robustness with token cost.

If you want, I can also mock up the **exact artifacts** for a custom object return (e.g., returning a `Level`), including the `[Type_Explanations]` block the runtime would synthesize from MT-IR.
